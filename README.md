# odin-recipes
This is a re-do of the original Odin Recipes project for The Odin Project. I decided to go back and take the course over, and start from scratch as opposed to utilize the previous iteration. It is possible I will reference the original at times (as they have been backed up), but ideally this will be a completely new project. 

This project is to create a website displaying the recipes for three dishes that I enjoy. I am not attempting to make the site overly complex, rather just a basic introduction to html and CSS.
